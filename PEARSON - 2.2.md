# 2-2 Media - PEARSON

#### Types of Media

* **Media** propagate **signals** that carry **bits** of information
* Some common types
  * Wires >>
  * Fiber (fiber optic cables) >>
  * Wireless >>

---

#### Wires - Twisted Pair

* Very Common; used in LANs and telephone lines

  * Twists reduce tadiated signal

#### Wires - Coaxial Cable

* Also common. 

* Better shielding for better performance

* Other kinds of wires too

  * e.g., electrical power (book 2.2.4)

---

#### Fiber

* Long, thin, pure strands of glass

  * Enormous bandwidth ( high speed) over long distances

#### Fiber (2)

* Two veriesties

  * Multi-mode (shorter links, cheaper)

  * Single-mode (up to ~ 100 km)

#### Wireless

* Sender radiates signal over a region

  * In many directions, unlike a wire, to potentially many receivers

  * nearby signals (same freq.) interfere at a receiver; need to coordinate use

#### Wireless (2)

* Microwavev, e.g., 3G

* Unlicensed (ISM) frequencies, e.g., WiFi , are widely used for computer networking
